# Posture-Classifier
A posture classifier uses the data from the accelerometer to classify the human posture.

All the raw data collected can be found in the folder ***data***.

The trained model has been exported into ***RNN*** and ***random_forest***.

In order to use the model, you need to use ***mixed model.py***.

If you want to train the model yourself, you can use ***decision_tree.py*** and ***LSTM v1.3.py*** to train the model with your own data.
